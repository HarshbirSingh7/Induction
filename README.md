My first day at **GNDEC** started with all the students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was energetic, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for some time, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam (*HOD of Applied Sciences*). She motivated us to be disciplined in all walks of life and encouraged us to work hard in life.

Then our principal sir welcomed us on this auspicious occasion of the 70th anniversary of this institution and talked to us about the things that GNDEC has achieved in the past and told us about the inspiring stories of the alumni.

Then they gave us a tour of the college campus, while sharing valuable information.

My day at **GNDEC** started with a morning prayer. Harpreet mam introduced us to Dr. Priya Darshni, a very calm, kind and joyful personality. She first took introduction randomly of five students and asked them about what is their goal in life.

Then she started lecturing us about the subject "*Universal Human Values*". This was a amazing experience as we got to know that everybody's goal in life is same i.e "Happiness and Prosperity" and how to achive it. She also changed our mindset that physical facilities is not enough to be happy in life but having both good relationships and right understanding will make us happy in life.

Afterwards, Dr. Arvind Dhingra (*Director of STEM and Incharge of TAC*) gave us a lecture about how the engineer institution works and how to be a part of it. Then he also offered us to be a part of the activities done, at last it was a joyful experience.

At the start of the day, all of us were anxious for the gates of the auditorium to be opened. After some time, the gates were opened, the moment for which all of us were waiting.
First, we were told to recite the *sacred mantra* of our religion and to clear all the thoughts that were going on in our minds, so that we could focus on the lecture that was to be given.

Afterwards, team members of the **Causmic Club** took the stage to address us about their club. They showed us all the events that they managed and made them fruitful. They told us that the whole club is run by students themselves, and we can also become members, although it has some faculty members involved, too. They also guided us on how to use GitHub.

Then the talk about motorsports began, and it was very interesting for a guy like me who is very fond of cars and racing. Although it was only proceeded for a short time, it was amazing.

At last, there was a lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni further on "*Universal Human Values*"; it was good, and I got to know some new things about life. Afterwards, we went to the classes for our lectures.

There is nothing much to describe, as today we only attend college for a short period. But one lecture about millets was interesting. So a lecture about "**Millets Super Food**" was given by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar. She described how we can add millets to our daily diet and how much protein and fiber they can provide to our body. In this lecture, I learned about the benefits of millet for our health, including its ability to cure various day-to-day health issues and some serious diseases. She also taught us how to cook millet properly so that it can nourish our body well. This was all for today.
