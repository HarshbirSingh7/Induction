# Induction 2025 @ GNDEC
## Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all the students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was energetic, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for some time, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam (HOD of Applied Sciences). She motivated us to be disciplined in all walks of life and encouraged us to work hard in life.

Then our principal sir welcomed us on this auspicious occasion of the 70th anniversary of this institution and talked to us about the things that GNDEC has achieved in the past and told us about the inspiring stories of the alumni.

Then they gave us a tour of the college campus, while sharing valuable information.

## Day 2
My day at GNDEC started with a morning prayer. Harpreet mam introduced us to Dr. Priya Darshni, a very calm, kind and joyful personality. She first took randomly introduction five students
and asked them about what is their goal in life.

Then she started lecturing us about the subject "Universal Human Values". This was a amazing experience as we got to know that everybody's goal in life is same i.e "Happiness and Prosperity" and how to achive it. She also changed our mindset that physical facilities is not enough to be happy in life but having both good relationships and right understanding will make us happy in life.

Afterwards, Dr. Arvind Dhingra (Director of STEM and Incharge of TAC) gave us a lecture about how the engineer institution works and how to be a part of it. Then he also offered us to be a part of the activities done, although it was a joyful experience.
