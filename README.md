My first day at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** began with an assembly of all the students in the college auditorium. The atmosphere was vibrant and filled with anticipation. The stage was elegantly decorated, setting a warm and welcoming tone for the day.

The program commenced with an address by Dr. Harpreet Kaur, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences. She delivered an inspiring speech emphasizing the importance of discipline and consistent hard work in achieving success across all areas of life.

Following this, the Principal formally welcomed us on the momentous occasion of the 70th anniversary of the institution. He highlighted GNDEC’s legacy of academic excellence and shared remarkable achievements of the college over the years. His speech included motivating anecdotes about the college’s distinguished alumni, which left a lasting impression.

The orientation concluded with a guided tour of the campus, during which faculty members shared insightful information about various facilities, departments, and resources available to students

The day at **GNDEC** began with a peaceful morning prayer that set a calm and positive tone. Soon after, Harpreet Ma’am introduced us to Dr. Priya Darshni, who instantly came across as a warm, kind, and cheerful person. To break the ice, she randomly picked five students and asked them about their goals in life. It was a light yet thoughtful start that made everyone feel involved.

She then began a session on "**Universal Human Values**", which turned out to be much more engaging than I had expected. One of the most eye-opening parts was when she talked about how, deep down, all of us are striving for the same things — happiness and prosperity — and how we can achieve them. She helped shift our thinking by showing us that material things alone don’t bring happiness. Instead, it’s the quality of our relationships and having the right understanding of life that truly matter.

Later, we had a session with Dr. Arvind Dhingra, the Director of STEM and Incharge of TAC. He explained how the engineering institution functions and encouraged us to get involved in the various opportunities available on campus. His talk made me realize how much we can gain if we actively participate beyond just academics.

Overall, it was an inspiring and refreshing experience. I left feeling more connected to the college and excited for the journey ahead.

At the start of the day, all of us were anxious for the gates of the auditorium to be opened. After some time, the gates were opened, the moment for which all of us were waiting.
First, we were told to recite the *sacred mantra* of our religion and to clear all the thoughts that were going on in our minds, so that we could focus on the lecture that was to be given.

Afterwards, team members of the **Causmic Club** took the stage to address us about their club. They showed us all the events that they managed and made them fruitful. They told us that the whole club is run by students themselves, and we can also become members, although it has some faculty members involved, too. They also guided us on how to use GitHub.

Then the talk about motorsports began, and it was very interesting for a guy like me who is very fond of cars and racing. Although it was only proceeded for a short time, it was amazing.

At last, there was a lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni further on "*Universal Human Values*"; it was good, and I got to know some new things about life. Afterwards, we went to the classes for our lectures.

There is nothing much to describe, as today we only attend college for a short period. But one lecture about millets was interesting. So a lecture about "**Millets Super Food**" was given by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar. She described how we can add millets to our daily diet and how much protein and fiber they can provide to our body. In this lecture, I learned about the benefits of millet for our health, including its ability to cure various day-to-day health issues and some serious diseases. She also taught us how to cook millet properly so that it can nourish our body well. This was all for today.
